# Private guard overlay and portable package

This completes the packaging boundary from plan B decision 9. The repository
remains private. No repository publication, visibility change, licensing
decision, or historical-data sanitization is implied. The wheel contains the
portable `subfleet` core; the source distribution contains that core, README,
project metadata, and lockfile. Neither contains the private overlay, tests,
operator reports, or staging tools.

The reviewed operator pair moved unchanged to `private/guard/`:

| File | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- |
| `never-rules-hook.sh` | `a60d1c514d3a3bcec68c246a33c849c11fd37e1bdf60d886650cd9d6651390db` |
| `TRUST` | `0b9d688e6b2ca3adefdb8ad465c0fad5e6e18dfa884bc2309ff4f506c2287bab` |

No rule, reference-path pin, version pin, or provenance was regenerated. The
reference path in TRUST is historical input to the parity check. The actual
hook command and hooks/list identity are derived from the resolved installed
overlay path.

## First installation over the existing private release

The deployment owner performs these steps; packaging tests never touch installed
state. Use the actual daemon state root, including a custom `SUBFLEET_HOME` if
configured. In the private reviewed checkout, before changing the release pointer:

```sh
uv run python -m tools.stage_guard_overlay --source private/guard --state-root "$HOME/.subfleet"
```

The helper verifies the source pins, copies exact bytes into a fresh directory,
validates the copied pair, then renames the directory into `<state root>/guard`.
Its directory is mode 700, hook 755, and TRUST 600. It is idempotent only for an
already-valid, byte-identical pair and refuses a different or damaged existing
overlay. It does not generate TRUST, call Codex, alter releases, restart the
daemon, or rewrite active launches. A refused stage is an installation blocker;
do not deploy a core-only release and assume it will fall back to the old hook.

After staging, compare both installed files with the reviewed source and run
offline validation using the new source or staged release:

```sh
cmp private/guard/never-rules-hook.sh "$HOME/.subfleet/guard/never-rules-hook.sh"
cmp private/guard/TRUST "$HOME/.subfleet/guard/TRUST"
uv run python -c 'from pathlib import Path; from subfleet.doctor import check_guard_preflight; import os; r=check_guard_preflight(Path(os.environ.get("SUBFLEET_HOME", "~/.subfleet")).expanduser()); print(r); raise SystemExit(0 if r["status"] == "pass" else 7)'
```

Use the normal backed-up release installation and controlled daemon restart.
Preserve its configured state root, HOME/PATH, guard timeout/cache/TRUST
overrides, and provider CLI wrappers (including `current/bin/codex` when the
front-door shim points there). Staging at the state-root default requires no new
environment variable. A shell-only override does not configure launchd: existing
`SUBFLEET_GUARD_TRUST`, `SUBFLEET_CODEX_GUARD_CACHE`, and
`CODEX_GUARD_PREFLIGHT_TIMEOUT` overrides must be in its environment to survive a
restart. Explicit `preflight(hook_path=..., trust_path=...)` still wins over
defaults; a TRUST environment override does not change the default hook path.

**Retain all old release directories used by active launches.** Their recorded
`-c hooks=...` arguments still name the old bundled hook. The staged overlay and
new daemon do not rewrite those commands. Do not remove those releases until
the corresponding guardians and provider descendants have finished and normal
containment has confirmed this. Preserve guardian adoption through the daemon
restart using the existing deployment procedure. This migration changes no job,
attempt, lane ownership, or credential record. The native app is independent;
keep its installed version and do not infer it from the Python package version.

Offline doctor verifies the effective pair and reports its paths. It does not
claim runtime Codex trust: use the normal preflight (or explicitly authorized
`doctor --live`) to verify hooks/list before admitting executable Codex work.
The new absolute path and overlay pins produce a new cache key; existing cache
markers cannot stand in for this verification. A later approved hook replacement
at the same path also forces re-verification. Malformed or mismatched files are
checked on every launch, even when a cached verdict exists.

If deployment must roll back, restore the previous release pointer through the
normal rollback procedure and retain both old releases and the staged overlay.
Old releases keep their bundled resolution; new in-flight launches may already
name the external overlay. Removing either can break future tool calls in an
otherwise live provider session. Do not edit policy in place while sessions use
it; future policy revisions need their own reviewed rollout.

Claude's separately installed global hook and isolated read-only review behavior
are unchanged. The test fixture in `tests/fake/guard.py` is deliberately synthetic
and must never be staged as operator security policy. It is absent from both
prepared distributions, and the runtime has no test-fixture fallback.

## Verification

Run the full fake-provider suite, build both distributions with `uv build`, and
inspect their members and bytes before installing. Overlay regressions cover
missing and malformed pins, mismatch, executability, explicit/root resolution,
doctor/preflight agreement, same-path cache invalidation, exact idempotent staging,
refusal to overwrite different policy, and preservation of an old launch path.
Private source tests pin both original files, including TRUST provenance. Package
inspection must show no `private/`, `tests/`, bundled hook, or TRUST member and
no original private hook/TRUST payload. No provider or installed-state changes
are needed for this verification.
