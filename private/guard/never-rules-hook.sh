# subfleet-guard-hook — Codex CLI PreToolUse hook: the never-rules guard for
# subfleet codex lanes. Denies the nine standing NEVER rules that
# ~/.claude/hooks/guard-never-rules.sh enforces for Claude Code sessions.
#
# SOURCE OF TRUTH: ~/.claude/hooks/guard-never-rules.sh (and its harness,
# ~/.claude/tests/guard-never-rules-test.sh). Two sync contracts:
#   - The seven Bash rule blocks below are copied from that file BYTE-FOR-BYTE,
#     each from its column-0 "# --- <rule>:" header line up to (not including)
#     the next column-0 "# --- " (or "# >>>") line — comments, blank lines and
#     `block "…"` calls included; `block` is this hook's deny, so the ported
#     blocks run unmodified. Change the Claude hook first, run its harness,
#     then re-extract here (~/.cache/subfleet-guard-v2-port/proto/
#     extract_blocks.sh); never edit only one side.
#     tests/test_guard_never_rules.py::DriftTests pins the per-rule byte
#     identity, the prefilter literal, and the hf-dest literals.
#   - The unscoped-search rule is ONE SHARED REGION between the marker lines
#         (# >>> unscoped-search: shared region begin … >>>)
#         (# <<< unscoped-search: shared region end <<<)
#     intended byte-identical to the same region of the Claude hook. The
#     Claude half of that 2026-08-19 port-back (guard-portback) is not yet
#     installed; tests/test_guard.py::DriftTests compares the regions
#     and is skip-gated until it lands. NEVER edit the region in this file.
#
# Rules (one line each; details in docs/guard.md):
#   tg-getupdates    Telegram getUpdates polling steals the OpenClaw gateway's updates
#   keychain-dump    security dump-keychain -d on the login keychain (prompt storm)
#   trust-root       mutating AXIOM_*PUBLIC_KEY org variables (org-wide trust anchors)
#   corpus-squash    squash-merging PRs in axiom-corpus / rulespec-* (.github#39 rule 6)
#   corpus-push      pushing axiom-corpus main directly (.github#39 rule 6)
#   stash-shared     git stash in a repo with >1 worktree (stash stack is repo-global)
#   local-main       branching from local main when origin/main exists
#   unscoped-search  whole-tree find/rg/grep -r over broad roots (8/8 and 8/18 incidents)
#   hf-dest          editing HF upload destinations in policyengine-uk-data (adapted:
#                    Codex edits arrive as apply_patch payloads or shell heredocs)

#            (apply_patch is the freeform edit tool; matcher aliases Write/Edit.
#            Relative patch paths resolve against the turn cwd. A shell command
#            carrying an `apply_patch <<'EOF' …` heredoc arrives as tool_name
#            Bash and is judged as shell text PLUS the fenced hf-dest scan; its
#            deny reasons carry a codex-lane suffix saying so.)

# Any parse failure, missing jq, or a tool other than Bash/apply_patch -> allow
# (fail-open, like the Claude hook). The hook runs on the host, outside the
# sandbox, so `git -C "$cwd" ...` works in read-only lanes too.
# Telemetry: each denial appends one line to
#   ${CODEX_GUARD_LOG:-$HOME/.cache/subfleet-codex/guard-denials.log}
#   <ISO8601>\t<cwd>\t<command-or-patch, first 300 chars, tabs/newlines -> spaces>
# and logging failures never change the decision.
# Codex-only code is the hf-dest adapter (its helpers and the apply_patch
# branch) plus the fenced "codex-lane additions (hf-dest via shell heredoc)"
# step after the shared region; everything else is Claude-hook text verbatim.

# hf_dest_added_lines TEXT BASES
# Mirrors codex-rs apply-patch/src/streaming_parser.rs (used by the freeform
# tool AND the heredoc/lenient path): a line state machine. Prints the content
# of every '+' line that belongs to a section whose file, resolved against ANY
# base (relative paths joined to a base and normalised ., ..; absolute paths as
# is), contains "policyengine-uk-data".
#   NS  not started: trim(line)=="*** Begin Patch" -> SP; else ignored
#   SP/AF/DF: headers on trim(line): Environment ID (ignored), End Patch -> EP,
#       Add File -> AF (file), Delete File -> DF (out of scope), Update File -> UF.
#       In AF a RAW line starting with '+' is added content.
#   UF: headers only at column 0 (Codex: trim_end only; an indented header in an
#       update hunk is a CONTEXT line): End Patch -> EP, Add/Delete/Update File,
#       Move to: <q> (section also in scope if q resolves into uk-data).
#       RAW '+' lines are added content; ' ', '-', '@@', '*** End of File' ignored.
#   EP: everything ignored except trim(line)=="*** Begin Patch" -> SP (a second
#       patch in the same shell command also executes via the apply_patch alias).
# trim() here matches Rust str::trim()/trim_end() (Codex's parser): it strips
# the full Unicode White_Space set (U+0085, U+00A0, U+1680, U+2000-U+200A,
# U+2028, U+2029, U+202F, U+205F, U+3000), not just the ASCII bytes POSIX
# [:space:] sees under LC_ALL=C — otherwise a header prefixed with e.g. a
# no-break space parses for Codex but not here, and the change slips through.
# BASES are passed as the leading stdin lines (count via -v NB), not ENVIRON:
# it avoids the ENVIRON size limit and lets scope be tested against every base
# in ONE pass (a command with thousands of `cd` targets was O(bases x length)).

# --- unscoped-search: whole-tree searches over broad roots saturate the SSD ---
# Incidents:
#   2026-08-08  8+ parallel encoder-lane find/rg crawls of the mirrors, home
#               and /tmp drove the load average to 47 and beachballed the UI.
#   2026-08-18  the e8 sol batch (codex lanes) ran ~22 parallel `find / ...`
#               and `find /Users/maxghenis ...` crawls; load held at 57 for
#               hours.
# Design (a regex judgment over the command text, not a parse):
#   searcher   find, rg, or grep with a recursive flag, preceded by a line
#              start, whitespace, `;`, `&`, `|` or `(` — the three detection
#              regexes both hooks have always used (also the prefilter term).
#   escape     any `-maxdepth` / `--max-depth` in the command disarms the rule
#              (a depth-bounded search is fine).
#   roots      `/`, `/*`, `/Users`, `/Users/<user>`, `~`, `$HOME` (`${HOME}`
#              is read as `$HOME`), their TheAxiomFoundation / RulesFoundation
#              / PolicyEngine / Library/Caches / .cache / .local children,
#              `/tmp`, `/private/tmp` — each with or without a trailing slash.
#   judged     backslash-newline continuations are joined first (as the shell
#              does) and `${HOME}` is spelled `$HOME`; then collapse_quotes
#              turns every quoted string into the placeholder Q, except a
#              quoted string whose whole content IS a root (kept, unquoted:
#              `find "$HOME"/ …`, `rg pat "/"`) and a sub-script that
#              mentions a searcher (`bash -c "cd x && find / -name y"`,
#              kept visible). In the main position matcher, a root inside a
#              pattern, prose, or a commit message does not fire. The raw
#              searcher/cwd check is intentionally more conservative; its
#              quoted-prose residue is documented in the README.
#   position   a root counts only where a searcher would read it as a path:
#              anywhere in find's own pipeline segment (up to -exec/-ok); in
#              PATH position of rg/grep — after the pattern positional, with
#              value-taking options and their values skipped; with -e/-f/
#              --regexp/--file/--files in that rg/grep segment anywhere in
#              the segment (the option's own value excepted); anywhere in the
#              command when `xargs` runs a searcher (a deliberately
#              conservative exception to the ordinary pipeline ownership
#              rule); as the target of cd/pushd
#              while any searcher is present; and `.`/`./` when the cwd itself
#              is a broad root. A root in another command of the pipeline
#              (`ls ~ | rg x`) or in pattern position (`rg / src`) is not a
#              crawl and passes.
#   matched    the token that fired is named at the end of the block message
#              (`Matched broad root: '…'.`), `'<root> (after cd)'` for the cd
#              rule and `'. (cwd <cwd>)'` for the cwd rule.
#   no override: a blocked command stays blocked — no env var, no magic
#              comment, nothing in the command text lets a crawl through.
# Accepted false positives and known gaps (the residue of a regex judgment)
# are listed in ~/chief-of-staff/subfleet/docs/guard.md, "Known false positives"
# and "Known gaps".

# First match of $2 in $1, minus quotes and the surrounding delimiters (the
# token that fired, for the block message). Best-effort; empty is fine.

# `rg <pattern> ... <root>` run).
last_word_of_match() {
  first_match "$1" "$2" | sed 's/.*[[:space:]]//'
}
# The command with every quoted string collapsed to the placeholder Q — except
# a quoted string that is a SUB-SCRIPT and mentions a searcher: it must contain
# a searcher word AND be the argument of a shell (`bash -c "..."`, `sh -lc`,
# `zsh -c`, `eval "..."`, `xargs ... sh -c '...'`), i.e. the text right before
# the quote ends in `-c`/`-lc`/`eval`/`sh`/`bash`/`zsh` plus whitespace. Such a
# string stays visible (its own inner quotes collapsed the same way) so
# `bash -c "cd x && find / -name y"` is still judged; ordinary prose that
# merely mentions a searcher (`git commit -m "Add find / replace dialog"`,
# `echo "run: find / -name x" >> notes.md`) becomes Q like anything else.
# Mode "roots" (arg 2, with the root regex as arg 3, passed through the
# environment so awk sees it byte-for-byte) emits a quoted string whose WHOLE
# content is a broad root unquoted instead (`rg pat "/"` -> `rg pat /`,
# `find "$HOME"/ ...` -> `find $HOME/ ...`), so the position-aware rules
# below can judge it. Line by line; a quote spanning lines is left as is
