"""C-6.9: FIFO within a tier holds among jobs that compete for a model, and no further.

Incident, 2026-09-20: an Opus review with no admissible lane (every Claude lane
`reserve:fable:unmeasured`, Astra closed until the next day) sat at the head of
the `standard` tier. `_admit` held the whole tier behind it, so three
Fable-pinned handoff jobs stayed queued for hours beside eleven free Fable
lanes, and nothing at all was admitted for more than three hours.
