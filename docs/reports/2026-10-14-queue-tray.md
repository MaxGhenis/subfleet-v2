# Queue tray on release/217 — 2026-10-14

Built from `5a711114e9654310f00e8490d5abf16dcdd02920`, following Max's
2026-09-28 queue and opening-scroll requests. The archived tray is reference
only; this implementation retains release/217's steer, recall, final Timeline
API, request-id approval joins, reconciliation and work-group presentation.

## Design as built

`Timeline.layout` splits scrolling items from compact tray rows. A person
message waits in the tray exactly while a live turn, a conversation block or
an earlier dispatchable message is ahead. The first idle send stays in the
timeline across its `queued` receipt. Dispatch order follows the current daemon:
repairs, missed steers, ordinary messages, wakes; sequence within each group,
then arrival order for sends without receipts. Queued failover continuations
remain timeline notices and count as ahead.

The tray is pinned immediately above the composer. Rows show a two-line
preview, optional status, and Withdraw. The eligible head offers Send now
through the existing steer path; slash commands, shell input, narrow permissions,
non-running hosts and busy rows do not offer it. Unblock notes have no Withdraw.
Long queues expand into at most 200 points of rows; short expanded queues shrink.
The preview and controls use the conversation's reading font scale. Pending and
refused steers retain their existing status words on the tray, including after restart. Pre-start withdrawals use a dedicated single-line view,
without the generic notice card or a duplicate status caption.

Withdrawal uses the existing outbox before receipt and `message.cancel` after
receipt. Dispatch races retry at 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 and 1 seconds. Too-late reads
that message's status and interrupts only its own live turn. Steering/steered
messages never cause an interrupt of their host. Not-running reads status again;
a second Withdraw is not an error. Local withdrawals and tombstones retain one
withdrawn line under the original person row id, preserving known text/images.
A turn that already began retains its bubble and work.

Fresh conversation identity and macOS 15's initial bottom anchor establish the
opening viewport. Catch-up changes and opening approval placement disable
animation. The person's own send glides; others follow only with the end visible.
Event-only messages from another client cannot masquerade as local sends. A
local-send marker survives a receipt arriving before SwiftUI's first update;
promoting an older queued message does not count as a new local send.

## Confirmed bugs and audit gaps

- Flicker: membership tests and receipt-transition properties keep an idle send
  in the timeline before receipt, after queued, and after dispatch starts.
- Tombstones: the original withdrawal line remains visible, including real daemon
  tombstones and known attachments.
- Waiting failover continuation: counts as ahead; a later send enters the tray.
  The heading says it follows the message ahead, rather than claiming it is next.
- Expanded layout: content sizing fixes both short expanded queues and queues
  withdrawn to four rows. Both old strict xfails are normal passing regressions.
- M7: state-only sending controls exercise outbox withdrawal without an entry.
- M17: waiting, starting, running and approval-needed each exercise interrupt.
- M19: stop(withdraw) during an in-flight send returns no receipt and no error.
- O1: a steerable busy head has no Send now or second Withdraw.
- O2b: expanded Withdraw buttons are checked in visual top-to-bottom order.
- O8: busy spinner counts match a separately hosted real ProgressView reference.

Every required mutation was applied to a separate workspace-local source copy
and tested under its own lock hold. All ten were killed by assertions, with no
compile errors: flicker (1 failure), tombstone (1), waiting continuation (2),
expanded sizing (2), M7 (1), M17 (1), M19 (1), O1 (1), O2b (1), O8 (1).
The mutation runs selected 41 cases in total.

## Send-failure stack seam (draft PR #213, C-29.17)

The stack is not merged into this branch. `ConversationStoreState.layout(
conversationID:)` is the view's projection; `QueuedMessage.id` is the message id.
`QueueTray.notice` takes that id and returns an optional `AnyView`, rendered
inside its owning row; the hosted-view regression supplies a notice and Try
again action and checks both stay on that row. The notice's actions are disabled
while withdrawing. A stack landing second can pass its existing SendNoticeView
through this closure, attach its status to `layout.tray[index].status`, and keep
the timeline notice only for ids in `layout.items`. Filter the notice's own
Withdraw link because the row supplies it; waiting notices need only the status
caption, so the content closure can return nil for those. This avoids importing the
old stack's SendNotice type or renumbering its contract clause.

The rescued placement tests must use `startReading` (not `beginReading`),
`withdrawLocal(conversationID:messageID:)`, final approval reconciliation and
request-id joins. Do not restore the old rule that all queued messages are in
the tray or that tombstones disappear. `withdrawSend`/`WithdrawResult` distinguish
a true local withdrawal from an in-flight send; UIModel.stop routes sending
withdrawals through the same method as the tray. A daemon-known settled receipt
is retained rather than leaving an old Sending state visible.

## Validation

Completed passing suites: `test_core_queue_tray.py` 44,
`test_core_queue_engine.py` 75, `test_queue_tray_view.py` 15,
`test_core_steer.py` 43, and `test_queue_tray_notice.py` 2. The final Swift source
builds through `app/build.sh` with the release target and signing checks.
Existing Swift Sendable-capture and unnecessary-await warnings remain. The
first broader batch passed 83 of 84 cases in 19m52s. Its one failing
approval-timeline property still excluded queued continuations in its reference,
which conflicts with the required failover fix. Commit `3c0ba3226` updates that
independent reference from `next_dispatchable`, including missed repairs and
wakes, and adds a concrete regression. The corrected 41-case file is queued for
a rerun; Python syntax validation passes. Per-file results and shared-lock
omissions follow.

Tests run as foreground, one pytest per shared lock hold,
with temporary Hypothesis storage and no deep profile. New queue properties
use bounded 40-example CI settings; existing properties keep their bounded settings. The 300-case coverage check runs independent timelines in groups of five
per native process to avoid excessive launches. Native
probes host views offscreen and use synthetic state; the app is built but never
installed or launched.

One follow rerun took 35m50s in its locked pytest process (42 passed, 2 failed),
exceeding the requested 20-minute hold. The run stayed in the foreground and was
not relaunched. It found a missing viewport-change key during catch-up and a
coverage generator that rarely made an idle send while reading higher up. Both
were corrected; the CI sampling and coverage batching above bound later runs.
The repaired two-file run held the lock for 360.9 seconds: foundation 43 passed
and one stale viewport expectation failed, notice 2 passed. That expectation
is corrected in `1ea3bf992`; the final 44-case rerun passed in 256.9 seconds
of pytest time. Broader checks remain queued. Queue wait is separate from time
holding the lock.

## Delivery and remaining work

The shared Git index is read-only in this sandbox. Commits use workspace-local
metadata at `build/queue-tray-git`, branch `feat/queue-tray-217`, with object reads
from the shared repository. No history is rewritten and nothing is pushed.

Known separately filed follow-up `task_94fbb104` remains: watch changes update
only already-known messages, so an externally submitted or daemon-created message (including a CLI send,
unblock note or continuation not yet known locally) first appears after
reopening the conversation. This is outside the rebuild's requested scope.

## Counts per file

These are the latest completed runs per file as of 12:47 UTC. A pending run
is not counted as a pass. The approval-reference rerun and the
remaining broad batches are still queued. The foreground runner remains active;
the sandbox denied a signal to its wrapper, so it was left unchanged.
